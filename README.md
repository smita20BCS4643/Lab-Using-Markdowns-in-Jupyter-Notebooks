# Lab-Using-Markdowns-in-Jupyter-Notebooks
Lab: Using Markdowns in Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are composed of code and markdown cells. Markdown cells are used to present text, images, etc. and are useful to document and explain the contents of your notebook. In this lab, you will become familiar with writing markdown.

# Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Identify in which Kernel your Jupyter notebook is running
- Create headings, and add text in bold and italics in Markdown
- Insert links and images using Markdown
- Create Tables in Markdown
- Create ordered and unordered lists in Markdown
- Demonstrate your proficiency in using Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks


# Exercise 1
Kernels in Jupyter notebook
A notebook kernel is a computational engine that executes the code in a Notebook file.

When the Notebook is executed, the kernel performs the computation and produces the results.

On the top right corner you can see the kernel's name. For instance, in JupyterLite, the default kernel is Pyolite. Similarly, if you are working on JupyterLab, the kernel will be Python 3 or Python 2, depending on the version.

#### Try yourself:

* Click the running Kernel, For Example, **Pyolite**, to see which other kernels are available.<br/>

  > _Please don't switch the existing kernel._

the output looks like

* Check the state of the kernel by clicking on the circle next to it.

# Exercise 2
Create headings, and add text in bold and italics in Markdown
Let us explore basic markdown elements such as:

- Headings
- Bold Text
- ItalicText


## Headings
* You can create headings by adding a # sign before a word or a phrase.

  - There are six levels of headings.
  - The number sign # indicate the level of heading for example # Hello corresponds to level 1,the highest level heading.
  - Display the following text using six different heading levels.
    
    1. H1: This is a level 1 Heading
    2. H2: This is a level 2 Heading
    3. H3: This is a level 3 Heading
    4. H4: This is a level 4 Heading
    5. H5: This is a level 5 Heading
    6. H6: This is a level 6 Heading

## Bold Text 
 * You can create bold text by adding two asterisks or underscores before and after a word, phrase, or a sentence.
 * Convert the cell below to markdown cell and execute it.

# Execute it as a markdown cell
**Bold Text using asterisks.**  
__Bold Text using underscores.__

## Italic Text
* You can display text in italics by adding a single asterisk or underscore before and after a word, phrase, or a sentence.

* Convert the cell below to markdown cell and execute it.
